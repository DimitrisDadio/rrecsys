Description: This library provides implementations of several popular recommendation algorithms. By using this library we can process standard recommendation datasets (e.g., a user-item rating	matrix) as input and generate rating predictions and lists of recommended items. Standard algorithm implementations which are included in this package are the following: Global/Item/User-Average baselines, Weighted Slope One, Item-Based KNN, User-Based KNN, FunkSVD, BPR and weighted ALS. They can be assessed according to the standard offline evaluation methodology for recommender systems using measures such as MAE, RMSE, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC, NDCG, RankScore and coverage measures. The package is intended for rapid prototyping of recommendation algorithms and education purposes.
