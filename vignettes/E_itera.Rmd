## Iterative updates

Three of the included algorithms in rrecsys (SVD, BPR and wALS) require to iterate a sequence of code until a convergence criterion is met. In analogy to Lenskit, we implemented two loop controllers for iterative updates. The first stops once an iteration count reaches the specied value. The second stops when the error drops under a specied threshold and this condition is met for a predened number of required
multiple consecutive iterations.
