## Item-based k-nearest neighbors in rrecsys

Given a target user and her positively rated items, the algorithm will identify the k-most similar items for each target _a_ and will rank them according to aggregated similarities with the different targets as described by Sarwar et al. For similarity computation among two co-rated items the "adjusted cosine" is applied. This implementation is based on the implementation on recommenderlab by Michael Hahsler.
To train a model is required to define an additional argument, _neigh_ the neighborhood size.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
subML <- ML[rowRatings(ML)>=40, colRatings(ML)>=30]
ibknn <- rrecsys(subML, "ibknn", neigh = 20)
```
The _neigh_ default value is 10.
