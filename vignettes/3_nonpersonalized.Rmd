## Non-personalized RS in rrecsys

The included baseline predictors are the global mean rating (Global Average), itemâ€™s mean rating (Item Average), user's mean ratings (User Average) as well as an unpersonalized Most Popular method that determines item popularity based on the total number of (positive) ratings.
Training a model with them:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(rrecsys)
data("mlLatest100k")
ML <- defineData(mlLatest100k, minimum = .5, halfStar = TRUE)
# The maximum value of the dataset might not be required since the default value coincides to the actual maximal value of the dataset.
globAv <- rrecsys(ML, alg = "globalaverage")

# Algorithm names might be matched on the registry partially.
itemAv <- rrecsys(ML, "itemAver")

userAv <- rrecsys(ML, "useraverage")
```
Baseline recommenders do not require any argument.
